### About the app:

The application is a clone for facebook's realtime posting functionality. You can find the deployed app on: https://tonnyz-fb-clone.web.app/

### Functionality

The application only clones facebook's posts:<br />
=> You can add a post message and also post an image in the image URL(image input is optional).<br />
=> To see realtime feedback, create a post in the _What is on your mind_, you could also add an image in the image URL textbox. This clone is powered by react and firebase-cloud firestore database!..<br />

### Development

=> The application is developed with React JS, using the REACT context API to manage the posts made; the users, their user pictures, names etc.<br />
=> Firebase is used to manage authetication i.e sign-in and sign-out: I chose the google authetication but any other means like email, apple and other authetication can be used.<br />
=> In addition, Material-UI was used for icons.
